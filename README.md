## Refactor Applications to Kubernetes

The tackle project repositories contain tools that support the modernization and migration of applications to Kubernetes.  

The first tools added to tackle are the Application Inventory and Pathfinder.  
It comprises 3 microservices and accessible from a common [Tackle UI](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle-ui/).  

* [Tackle Application Inventory](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle-application-inventory) allows users to maintain their portfolio of applications, link them to the business services that they support, define their interdependencies, and use an extensible tagging model to add metadata to describe and categorise them in multiple dimensions. The Application Inventory is the vehicle by which an application can be selected for assessment by Pathfinder.  

* [Tackle Pathfinder](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle-pathfinder) is a questionnaire based tool that assesses the suitability of applications for modernization in order to be deployed in Containers on an enterprise Kubernetes platform. Through interaction with the questionnaire, and review process, the system is enriched with application knowledge which is exposed via a collection of reports. The reports provide information about applications’ suitability for Kubernetes, highlight associated risks, and generate an adoption plan informed by the applications’ prioritization, business criticality and dependencies.  

* [Tackle Controls](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle-controls) are a collection of entities that add value to Application Inventory and the Pathfinder assessment. They comprise of Business Services, Stakeholders, Stakeholder Groups, Job Functions, Tag Types and Tags.
