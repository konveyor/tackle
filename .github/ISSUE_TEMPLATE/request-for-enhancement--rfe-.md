**What is your persona?**

Replace: Consider your role as an end-user so we can understand more about
your concerns. Some examples:

* I'm an application developer that is also responsible for the deployment of
my application, but I do not have cluster administrative privilege within my
multi-tenant cluster.
* I'm an application admin that plays an SRE role, responsible for the health
deployment of the application, but I am not necessarily a developer of the application
itself.
* I'm a cluster administrator with a high level of privilege. I'm
not aware of individual application details or their concerns, but I'm responsible
for the cluster as a whole.

**What is your story / use case?**

As a <persona>, I [want to do a thing], [so that I'm able to do...]

What is your specific intent, not necessarily the feature you want, but what are
you trying to achieve?

How does your immediate need fit into your bigger picture? What's the overall
benefit?

**Do you have a suggestion for implementation?**

It's important to decouple implementation from the story and use case itself,
but do you have a proposed solution that would serve your needs?
